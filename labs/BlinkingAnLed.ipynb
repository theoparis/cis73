    "### Objectives\n",
    " * Part 1: Setting up the Prototyping Lab with the Raspberry Pi\n",
    " * Part 2: Set up the Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter Lab Application\n",
    " * Part 3: (Challenge) Implement an International Morse code Help Signaler\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background / Scenario \n",
    "In this lab you will learn more about how the Raspberry Pi can be used together with the Arduino to write an application that interacts with external electronics using the GPIO ports on the Raspberry Pi. In Part 1, you will build a simple circuit with an external LED that is connected to the GPIO ports on the Raspberry PI. In Part 2, you will use the Jupyter Notebook to create a program to that will blink the LED when uploaded and run on the Raspberry Pi.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 3 challenges you to modify the Blockly code to have the LED blink the International Morse code signal for help.\n",

    "### \tRequired Resources\n",
    " * PC with Internet Access\n",
    " * Raspberry Pi with power cable and either a wired or wireless network connection\n",
    " * Raspberry Pi that is configured Jupyter Notebook access"
